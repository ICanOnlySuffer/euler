# Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains some solutions to the [Project Euler](
https://projecteuler.net/about) problems in various languages such as
C, Ruby, Python, Rust and POSIX Shell.

I am solving these problems to learn better practices and understand
better some programming languages I rarely use (like Rust and Python).
None of the code here is taken from any other source.
